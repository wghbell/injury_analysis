# We're doing more with our Serious Injury Outcome Indicators data
# Come with us as we explore Suicide and Intentional Self-Harm in more detail
# Please note: this code is designed to work on Stats NZ systems, therefore file paths / folders will only be applicable in that environment
# Warning: this code deals with the subject of suicide and may be distressing for some people

# Research question: are suicides different from non-fatal intentional self-harm?

# 1. Set working directory
setwd("~/Network-Shares/U-Drive-SAS-02BAU/SocPopStats/CPR/Injury/Chartbooks")

# 2. Install some required packages
# Our data is stored in SAS datasets (sas7bdat) with compression, so the "sas7bdat" package won't work
# Instead we need "haven"
# see https://garthtarr.github.io/meatR/rio.html for more
install.packages("haven")
library(haven)

# 3. Read in dataset(s)
# Occupations
# Note: occupations have been manually coded to ANZSCO using the raw "occupation" field and the Classification Code Finder
# convert from SAS to R code

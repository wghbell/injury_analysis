# How will the aging population impact NZ's suicide rates?

# Steps: 
# 1: baseline age-standardised rate
# derive age-standardised rate using ageadjust.direct (and cf ageadjust.indirect if possible) in EPITOOLS pkg with the following parameters:
# count = 5-year average count of suicides by age-group
# pop = 5-year average population estimate by age-group
# rate = NULL
# stdpop = WHO standard population
# conf.level = 0.95

# 2: derive expected number of suicides by age-group

# 3: calculate age-standardised rates using expected number of suicides and Stats NZ population projections

# Population estimates
